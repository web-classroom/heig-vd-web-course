For the lab, if you complete all the tests, you can submit your work. But it
will give you a 5.8. To have 6, you have to publish your work on GitHub Pages.
Here's a workflow you can add to your `.github/workflows` folder to
automatically publish your work on GitHub Pages:
[https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/static.yml](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/static.yml).
Maybe you need to modify it a bit to fit your needs (look at the `path`
variable). And Post a discussion here
([https://github.com/orgs/web-classroom/discussions](https://github.com/orgs/web-classroom/discussions))
when it's done, with the link of your GitHub Pages.
