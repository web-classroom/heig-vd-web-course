For the lab, if you complete all the tests, you can submit your work. But it will give you a 5.8. To have 6, you have to publish your work on GitHub Pages. Here's a workflow you can add to your `.github/workflows` folder to automatically publish your work on GitHub Pages: [https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/static.yml](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/static.yml). Maybe you need to modify it a bit to fit your needs (look at the `path` variable). And Post a discussion here ([https://github.com/orgs/web-classroom/discussions](https://github.com/orgs/web-classroom/discussions)) when it's done, with the link of your GitHub Pages.
