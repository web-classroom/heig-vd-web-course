For the lab, do not forget to push your modifications to GitHub. The GitHub
Actions will tell you if you passed all the tests.

You do not have to publish your website on GitHub Pages; it is not possible for
this lab. Sorry for the confusion.

The grading will be done by the GitHub Actions; if you pass all the tests, you
can be eligible for the full grade, but if we see some code that is too
complicated, we can reduce the grade. You should not need more than one
`position: absolute` and you do not need to use `position: relative` for this
lab
